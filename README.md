# pi_photobooth

At the core, this photobooth is targeted at controlling DSLR cameras and using Raspberry Pi GPIO for push button control

This photobooth is based on the following libraries
- libgphoto2 and gphoto2 
- piggyphoto (can possibly be written out with other python libraries)
- pygame (for image visualization)
- Google API (for upload)

MUCH more testing needs to be done, hard coding obviously to be removed, etc
